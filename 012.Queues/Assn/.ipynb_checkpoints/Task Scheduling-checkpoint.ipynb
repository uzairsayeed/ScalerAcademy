    "A CPU has N tasks to be performed. It is to be noted that the tasks have to be performed in a specific order to avoid deadlock. In every clock cycle the CPU can either perform a task or move it to the back of the queue. You are given the current state of the scheduler queue in an array A and the required order of the tasks in an array B.\n",
