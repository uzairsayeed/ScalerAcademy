    "### Implementation using collections.deque:\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue in Python can be implemented using deque class from the collections module. Deque is preferred over list in the cases where we need quicker append and pop operations from both the ends of container, as deque provides an O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to list which provides O(n) time complexity. Instead of enqueue and deque, append() and popleft() functions are used.\n"
