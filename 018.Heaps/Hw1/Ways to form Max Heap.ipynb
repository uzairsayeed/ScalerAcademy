    "## Ways to form Max Heap:\n",
    "Max Heap is a special kind of complete binary tree in which for every node the value present in that node is greater than the value present in itâ€™s children nodes. If you want to know more about Heaps.\n",

    "So now the problem statement for this question is: How many distinct Max Heap can be made from n distinct integers In short, you have to ensure the following properties for the max heap :\n",

    "Heap has to be a complete binary tree ( A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. )\n",
