    "## Ways to form Max Heap 2:\n",
    "Max heap is a special kind of complete binary tree in which for every node the value present in that node is greater than the value present in itâ€™s children nodes. If you want to know more about Heaps.\n",

    "So now the problem statement for the question is: Given an array of size n consisting of n-1 distinct elements.In other words there is exactly one element that is repeated.It is given that the element that would repeat would be either the maximum element or the minimum element. Find the number of structurally different max heaps possible using all the n elements of the array that is max heap of size n.\n",
