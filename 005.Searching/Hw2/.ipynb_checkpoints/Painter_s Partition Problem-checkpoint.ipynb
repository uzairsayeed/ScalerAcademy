    "## Painter's Partition Problem:\n",
    "You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.\n",

    "2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.\n",
